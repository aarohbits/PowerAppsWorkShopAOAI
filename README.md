# Overview 

Integration of Power Platform with Azure OpenAI Labs

1.	Seamless Integration: Azure Open AI provides seamless integration with Power Platform's low-code development environment, allowing users to easily incorporate AI capabilities into their applications and workflows. This integration eliminates the need for complex coding and enables users to enhance productivity by leveraging AI without extensive programming knowledge.

2.	Pre-built AI Models: Azure Open AI offers a wide range of pre-built AI models that can be readily integrated into Power Platform applications. These models cover various domains such as natural language processing, image recognition, sentiment analysis, and more. By utilizing these pre-built models, users can quickly add advanced AI capabilities to their low-code applications, saving time and effort in developing AI algorithms from scratch.

3.	Custom AI Models: In addition to pre-built models, Azure Open AI enables users to train and deploy their own custom AI models within the Power Platform environment. This empowers users to address specific business requirements and build AI solutions tailored to their unique needs. With low-code development and Azure's powerful AI capabilities, users can improve productivity by rapidly developing and deploying custom AI models without extensive coding expertise.

4.	Data Integration and Analysis: Azure Open AI provides seamless data integration capabilities, allowing users to connect Power Platform applications with various data sources, both on-premises and in the cloud. This integration enables users to leverage AI algorithms to analyze and extract insights from large volumes of data, enhancing productivity by automating data processing tasks and generating valuable insights for decision-making.

5.	AI-Driven Automation: With Azure Open AI and Power Platform's low-code capabilities, users can create intelligent workflows and automate repetitive tasks using AI algorithms. For example, they can build chatbots for customer support, automate document processing and analysis, or develop predictive models for forecasting. By automating these tasks, users can significantly improve productivity, streamline operations, and allocate resources more efficiently.
Overall, the combination of Azure Open AI and Power Platform's low-code development environment empowers users to harness the power of AI to improve productivity. Whether through pre-built models, custom AI development, data integration, or automation, this integration offers a streamlined and efficient approach to incorporating AI capabilities into applications and workflows.

## Prerequisites 

1.	**Registration**: Begin by registering for Azure Open AI by visiting the following link: [Azure Open AI Registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview). This registration process will provide you access to the Azure Open AI service.

2.	**Resource Creation**: After your registration is approved, log in to the Azure portal and create an Azure Open AI resource. This resource will serve as the foundation for utilizing the Azure Open AI capabilities within your applications and workflows.

3.	**Region Selection**: During the resource creation process, ensure that you select the US and Europe  [region](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview) as your preferred region. Choosing the correct region will ensure you have access to the desired AI capabilities. On 01 June 2023, these regions are supported.
a)	East US
b)	South Central US
c)	West Europe
d)	France Central

4.	**Resource Deployment**: Once the Azure Open AI resource is successfully created, proceed to create a deployment within the resource. This deployment allows you to configure and manage the specific AI models and services you want to utilize. You can customize the deployment based on your requirements and the specific AI capabilities you want to incorporate into your applications.

5.	**Utilization and Integration**: With the deployment set up, you can now start utilizing the Azure Open AI services within your applications and workflows. This includes integrating the AI models, leveraging the available APIs and SDKs, and utilizing the AI capabilities to enhance productivity, automate tasks, and gain valuable insights from your data.
